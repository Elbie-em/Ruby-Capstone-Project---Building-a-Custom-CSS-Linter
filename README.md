- **Terminal(Mac & Linux) or Command Prompt(Windows)**:
 - Clone the repository to your local machine
 - Go to the bin file directory and locate the linter file
 - In the Shell run ln -s $PWD/checker /usr/local/bin/ or sudo ln -s $PWD/checker /usr/local/bin/
 - **NOTE**: If you have issues installing click [here](https://commandercoriander.net/blog/2013/02/16/making-a-ruby-script-executable/) for guidelines

- **Understanding the files and Content**
 - linter.rb : Main file responsible for running the application.
 - user_file.rb : Contains a UserFile class that is responsible for reading the contents of CSS file provided by user.
 - css_inspector : Contains the CSSInspectorTool class that is responsible for inspecting the content of the CSS file provided by the user.
